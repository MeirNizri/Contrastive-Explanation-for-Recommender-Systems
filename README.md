## Interactive Explanations for Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are widely used and are present in many applications, such as movie recommendation, product sales, and content providers. 
However, current recommendation systems are usually stern and lack the ability to explain their decisions or allow the users to question them. 
We propose to develop algorithms for enabling recommendation systems to conduct explanatory interaction with users. 
In the first phase of our research, we will study contrastive explanations. That is, once receiving a recommendation (e.g., to buy a Samsung S22), 
the users will have the option to ask the system why it did not recommend a specific different item (e.g., Xiaomi 12). 
We intend to develop the ability to reply with a meaningful and convincing personalized explanation (e.g., it might seem that a good camera is 
very important to a specific user, and the Samsung S22 includes a better camera than the Xiaomi 12).

In the second phase of our research, we will extend our setting to multi-item contrastive explanations. 
The user can either post multiple contrastive queries simultaneously or sequentially. 
The system must provide an explanation that account for all queries (and possibly also previously provided explanations).

We believe that enabling recommendation systems to better interact with users and explain their recommendations, 
will result in more human-like recommendation systems that will be more accepted and trusted by users.
